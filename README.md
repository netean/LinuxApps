 LinuxApps
Saves time by listing all the appimages and flatpaks I need to install on every linux distro


##  install various flatpak files and appimages
 I work in IT and have various laptops kicking around from former colleagues.
 I will often reinstall them with something linux based - sadly I also have to reinstall windows
 from time to time as well
 I install the same list of apps on every distro and it's just a pain in the arse
 to go to flathub each and every time and install manually
 once click script is the answer.


 Tested with:
 Kde Neon 
 Kubuntu 25.04
 Nobara 42
 Ubuntu Cinnamon 25.04
 Monjaro (latest)

 Will work with crappy regular ubuntu, but you need to enable flatpak support first - as y'know. Ubuntu forces crappy Snaps on you that requite sudo to install!

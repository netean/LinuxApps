Originally just a script to install or uninstall various Flatpaks for a new Linux Setup
But has grown into a few other scripts that are useful for setting up a new device or, in some cases, resetting a device back to factory defaults (for Ubuntu)

Saves time by listing all the appimages and flatpaks I need to install on every linux distro


##  install various flatpak files and appimages
Add a list of files into the apps.txt - Give them the full name as found on Flathub

Run the installer script with path the apps.txt file as an argument


Tested on:
Arch (Manjaro)
Ubuntu (25.04)
Ubuntu Cinnamon (25.04)
Kubuntu
OpenSuse Tumbleweed
Nobara 42
